#Construct 2 Games

These games were made between May of 2015 and December of 2016, back when I had first begun to learn how games were made in middle school.

All of these games are playable, but most are unfinished and in many cases unfun. They simply rest here as a reminder of the journey I've taken in coming to love programming as a career and hobby.
